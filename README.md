let's talk about technical things here..
Re-Compile? You can use find ModelConverterX here : https://www.scenerydesign.org/development-releases/
asking for SDK? I'm using FSX/P3Dv1.4 SDK : http://cloud.prepar3d.com/SDK/Prepar3D_SDK_1.4.4747.0.exe (Direct download, FSX Compatible since P3Dv1 is direct release from LM after FSX SP2..which you can't kinda find its sdk anywhere now, only LM has it.)(This thing can be used from FSX all the way up to P3Dv5...I guesss, But P3Dv4 is fully compatible.)
Or You can go newest and use P3Dv2,3,4 SDK....that's your choice, Here : https://www.prepar3d.com/support/sdk/ LM's site for SDK... 
Remake AFCAD? Airport Design Editor here https://www.scruffyducksoftware.com/shop-and-downloads I use V1.79 as it's newest outta there


Download...Check out release tags


Every release is built on FSX so it will be compatible all the way up to P34v4...maybe V5 also, need testers 'bout that
